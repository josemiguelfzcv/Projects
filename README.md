# Projects

This repository showcases selected software projects developed during my CS undergraduate studies and hackathons. These tools focus on accessibility, intelligent planning, and applied data structures.

# Featured Projects

• Course Planner & Graduation Requirement Tracker — A Java-based academic planning platform that auto-generates schedules using a DAG engine, course preference data, and real-time requirement validation. Includes a custom GUI for intuitive navigation.

• VisionKeys — An eye-tracking interface created at HackHarvard 2025 enabling hands-free device control and text entry through gaze detection, leveraging computer vision and accessibility-focused design.
This repository reflects my interest in building practical systems that combine software engineering, human-computer interaction, and intelligent automation.
